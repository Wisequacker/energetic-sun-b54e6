course I took on computational econometrics. It was roughly a quarter long application project utilized to demonstrate the concepts and techniques taught. Analysis of six vanguard mutual funds helped figure out the general stability and variance/standard deviation between the various assets in question. The interesting metrics that I hoped to answer were the relative growth of the fund in comparison to each other, how similar the funds are, and much more.</p><p>First of all, this project put into perspective the necessary precautions with investments. Investment strategies aren’t cookie cutter and the individuals have different needs. It is important to cater to both risk aversion and the targeted return values of a portfolio. Diversification is a key element in order to help reduce the volatility that comes with uncertainty in the future. I think this puts into perspective the idea of trying to gain in the long term very meaningful because short term losses feel more impactful from a behavioral economics perspective. People have different reference points, but losses below someone’s reference point feel way worse than the equivalent gain of the same magnitude. This is explained from the perspective of loss aversion rather than risk aversion that challenges some of what classical economics has to say about people’s relation to fair gambles.  </p><p>Overall, each individual has their own risk tolerance and desirability for return goals. This project reinforced the ideas I’ve learned in terms of balanced portfolios based on the ratio of assets for an individual or given the possible trade restrictions with a balance of risk free and/or no risk-free assets.</p><p>Main Findings</p><p> • Stock tracking mutual funds like vfinx, veurx, veiex, and vpacx tend to have similar time trends overtime. This was seen with the downward trend that was found in those Vanguard funds within the years of both 2015 and 2018.</p><p> • The other two vanguard funds that track bonds, vbisx and vbltx, exhibited more movements together as there was a noticeable drop that occurred in the year of 2016 when Trump was elected. (Economic Times)</p><p>• Stock funds (vfinx, veurx, veiex, and vpacx) were positively correlated with another and the bond funds (vbisx and vbltx) were positively correlated with each other.</p><p>• The six Vanguard funds seemed to be normally distributed which allowed for GWN model analysis.</p><p>• Risk and return of some individual funds like vpacx, veurx and veiex were overshadowed because they had higher risk and overall lower returns comparatively to either vfinx or vbltx.</p><p>• Global minimum variance portfolio with or without short sale restriction had lower risk than holding any individual asset.</p><p>• Global minimum variance portfolio with short sale restrictions had a lower sharpe ratio and overall, more risk than the global minimum variance portfolio able to short sell.    </p><p>The following are some of the visualizations and calculations done within this project:</p><p><img src="/images/fundprices.png"/></p><p>1.A) Fund&#x27;s prices across time</p><p><img src="/images/fundreturns.png"/></p><p>1.B) Fund&#x27;s Return Across Time</p><p><img src="/images/covariance%20comparison.png"/></p><p>2.A) Covariance comparison of the various mutual funds</p><p><img src="/images/risk%20and%20return%20sharpe%20ratio.png"/></p><p>2.B) Risk and Returns of Various Funds/Sharpe Ratios of Assets</p><p><img src="/images/returnsboxnwhisker-fc71221f.png"/></p><p>2.C) Variability and Spread via Box-And-Whisker Plot of the Funds</p><p><img src="/images/univariate%20descriptive%20statistics.png"/></p><p>3.A) Univariate Descriptive Statistics of the Funds including Skewness and Kurtosis of Historical Data</p><p><img src="/images/gmvNoSS.png"/></p><p>4.A) Global Minimum Variance Portfolio -- Portfolio with the lowest amount of risk</p><p><img src="/images/efficientfrontierMarkowitzbullet.png"/></p><p>4.B) Markowitz Bullet/Efficient Frontier of Various Optimal Portfolios w/ and w/o trade constraints</p><p>After analysis it was possible to come up with the distributions, the type of assets these funds were tracking, and the optimal weights for short sell and short sell restricted scenarios for the funds. These samples of graphics above are some of the visualizations utilized to come up with such conclusions highlighted in the findings.</p><p>Going forward because of my interest in investments I hope to look more into the taxation aspects because it is an important facet as earnings are taxed. I wish to learn more about investments as there are ways to better portfolios and manage uncertainty. I feel like this is important both as an individual looking to partake in investments and also helping others make informed decisions about their own portfolios.</p></div></div></article><div

fishing is a beautiful time of day to relax and get in touch with nature","socialImage":"/images/desmond-eagle.png","addTitleSuffix":true,"markdown_content":"The following project was conducted as I was wanting to look at this sample HR database of a small business (database found from: https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/). To perform data analysis, I utilized SQL transactions to help answer pertinent questions from the database to consult the HR of a small business. I’ve grown to appreciate the relational database storage format because it is easy to edit/modify the database as needed and to reduce redundancy due to similar elements found in multiple rows of data in contrast to something like a spreadsheet or csv file. I would like to see more usage of relational databases to maintain information in the future because sometimes working with csv files aren’t that optimal.   \r\n\r\nBy examining this HR data provide indicators of the relationships between the small company and their employees. Some points of interest include employee pay, operational locations, and benefits. The end goal of this database exploration was to create a condensed report that would answer relevant questions I had about this company to help better understand its relationship with its employees. This way I could advise and make suggestions to help foster this company’s growth.  \r\n\r\nGeneral findings:\r\n\r\n·        It’s a small company with only 40 total employees/hires.\r\n\r\n·        The company has operations happening in a total of four countries.\r\n\r\n·        Regional data presented doesn’t included the continent of Australia or Antarctica\r\n\r\n![](/images/countriesHR.png)\r\n\r\n·        Hiring data has information that spans 1987 to 1999.\r\n\r\n·        After July 1994 the company saw the highest frequency of hirings and that month it had the maximum number of hirings in counting.\r\n\r\n·        30 total dependents and departments with the most dependents are purchasing and finance w/ six.\r\n\r\n·        Majority of employees tend to have a salary lower than the average salary pay for their particular occupation.\r\n\r\n·        Average maximum salary of all jobs on the market: $13,210.53\r\n\r\n·        Workers are paid below the averages of their respective salaries\r\n\r\nA more detailed report with visualizations can be found: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1droIn-avBqmZ3vRLnXugIwl875-Cdz_A/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nBased on the above findings, this company likely imports goods and sells these imported products because of their various roles that revolve around purchasing and selling. Since the business’ market details aren’t explicitly stated, that would be my best guess on the field of interest for this company. Additionally, this company is mostly based in North America (US and Canada) with workers working abroad in Europe. I think based on what I’ve seen I think it’s best to continue to grow their base in the United States before expanding to a more global reach as 1/3 of the hires are from the UK, Canada, and Germany. Furthermore, the data shows that workers are being paid less than typical salaries of such roles. I think this should definitely change as the company continues to grow; however, it is also likely that the company is currently too small and they have other possible benefits for their employees like stock shares or insurance coverage that makes their jobs worthwhile.           \r\n\r\nOverall, I feel like this SQL project was rewarding because this analysis allowed for the investigation of a small company to seek valuable information that could hint at the current relationship of its workers and the firm. I would have liked to see more information existing in this database because the data seemed quite limited since there are only 40 employees. Additionally, there is more room to gather relevant HR data for this company. I would like to see more information on the duration of hires since some employees quit/leave the company over time. I think moving forward from this project I would like to work with a larger dataset/database and create meaningful data visualizations and dashboards.\r\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/post-four.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"C:/Users/dchen/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/energetic-sun-b54e6/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/post-four.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/post-four.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/post-four"},"title":"MCU: Avengers Character Network Analysis","layout":"PostLayout","colors":"colors-a","author":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/hilary-ouse.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"C:/Users/dchen/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/energetic-sun-b54e6/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/hilary-ouse.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/hilary-ouse.json","modelType":"data","modelName":"Person","modelLabel":"Person"},"type":"Person","image":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/hilary-ouse.png","altText":"Hilary Ouse photo","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"ImageBlock","modelLabel":"Image"}},"firstName":"Danny, David, JJ, and Nate"},"excerpt":"Exploration of the vast character relationships within the Avengers utilizing machine learning.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/output_26_0.png","altText":"Post Thumbnail Image"},"media":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/output_26_0.png","altText":"Post Image","elementId":"guitar"},"bottomSections":[{"elementId":"","variant":"variant-d","colors":"colors-d","title":"Read more","showDate":false,"showAuthor":false,"showExcerpt":true,"recentCount":3,"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}},"type":"RecentPostsSection","showReadMoreLink":true,"readMoreLinkLabel":"Read more"},{"type":"DividerSection","colors":"colors-d","styles":{"self":{"width":"wide","padding":["pt-4","pb-4","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center","borderWidth":1,"borderStyle":"solid"}}}],"addTitleSuffix":true,"markdown_content":"The Marvel Cinematic Universe: Avengers Character Network Analysis is the final project done with a group for the cultural analytics course. Currently, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has a lot of heroes, and these independent hero stories come together under the umbrella of the Avengers as they fight for humanity. Of these heroes, our team wondered who is the most important original Avenger in the Marvel Cinematic Universe-- Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. This project is to debunk the relevance of characters in the major Avengers films where these six heroes appear together.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this project because I was able to lead our group as the other three had limited experience with Python. This project was inspired by the Network of Throne project, a Game of Thrones Network Analysis by Andrew Beveridge and Jie Shan (\u003chttps://tinyurl.com/NetworkofThrones\u003e). This was a meaningful project for us because we all liked the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I advocated for this ambitious project, despite most of my team members having limited coding experience because the cast of heroes in the MCU are quite vast. We all had favorites and we couldn’t decide who was the most connected and central character among the original six Avengers. I felt like there might be an overarching theme within the vast character connections despite their named and distinguished factions.\r\n\r\nThis project dataset was scraped from the movies wiki fandom (you can find more details on the collection and cleaning process on the GitHub \\[] or the published report). This was an interesting project because we got to do analysis utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and I got to web scrape for the first time. Although we were utilizing BookNLP (\u003chttps://github.com/dbamman/book-nlp\u003e), I felt that being able to utilize NLP and network analysis has changed my perspective of how we analyze data and try to find relationships between entities. BookNLP was trained to work with books and it fit well in our opinion to this project given the limited time we had for the project. It was fitting because film scripts are essentially longer prose driven by consistent dialogue and a fair amount of scene description. Being able to locate the proximity of characters' names near each other was impactful to understand the centralized characters and reinforce their importance in the franchise via the NetworkX python package.\r\n\r\nThis data analysis had some interesting discoveries that highlighted particular film releases and also the character dynamics of the six original Avengers. Our general finding from the character network analysis is that both Captain America and Iron man are the top characters centralized acrossed films. These characters top the network analysis measures by having the most connections and connecting the most characters to each other.\r\n\r\n![](/images/infinitywarbars.png)\r\n\r\n![](/images/endgamebars.png)\r\n\r\nBefore the release of Avengers Endgame, there have been numerous Captain America and Iron Man films dedicated to their stories which makes sense as they are the most centralized heroes. These prior films also highlight the internal battle of being leaders, especially during the Captain America Civil War film that featured the same six original Avengers. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Thor wasn’t as central compared to both Iron Man and Captain America. I think this puts into relative perspective the data can derive character personalities. Thor is known to act independently and is a mighty god whose actions speak louder than his words. Furthermore, since the overarching villain is Thanos after Ultron died, I expected these villains to be quite central as well in their relevant films. Comparatively it seemed like Thanos was definitely more feared than Ultron and Thanos was a major villain in both Infinity War and Endgame. As a film watcher, this also makes a lot of sense given Thanos had a lot of character development compared to Ultron over the course of his two films. A thorough MCU Character Network Analysis report can be found on here: https://tinyurl.com/MCUCharacterNetwork.\r\n\r\nThis character network analysis has allowed for the exploration of film releases and the development of heroes in the cinematic universe. It reinforces the ideas of leader, villain, and personality dynamics to shape the relationships of their heroes such as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Ultron, and Thanos. Overall, it feels like there are more ways to refine and continue to explore the vast character network in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are possible advancements in the project. In the future, it would be beneficial to thoroughly parse and remove named entities that aren’t heroes/characters within the film scripts. It may also be an interesting project to look into the word count by heroes to gauge the distributions of lines within a film.  After this project, I think the ability to add more films would also help with the character network analysis. The MCU films included in this project are the ones that included all the original six Avengers, but there are other relevant films with most if not a few of the original six.\r\n"},{"__metadata":{"id":"content/pages/blog/post-one.md","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"pages","sourcePath":"C:/Users/dchen/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/energetic-sun-b54e6/content/pages","relSourcePath":"blog/post-one.md","relProjectPath":"content/pages/blog/post-one.md","modelType":"page","modelName":"PostLayout","modelLabel":"Post","urlPath":"/blog/post-one"},"title":"Mutual Fund Report","layout":"PostLayout","author":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/team/dianne-ameter.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"C:/Users/dchen/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/energetic-sun-b54e6/content/data","relSourcePath":"team/dianne-ameter.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/team/dianne-ameter.json","modelType":"data","modelName":"Person","modelLabel":"Person"},"type":"Person","firstName":"Danny","lastName":"Chen","role":"Senior fisherwoman","image":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/dianne-ameter.png","altText":"Dianne Ameter photo","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"ImageBlock","modelLabel":"Image"}}},"excerpt":"Report investigating the performance and similarity between 6 Vanguard Mutual funds.","featuredImage":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/markus-winkler-IrRbSND5EUc-unsplash.jpg","altText":"Post thumbnail image"},"media":{"type":"ImageBlock","url":"/images/index funds by the growth of a dollar.png","altText":"Post Image","elementId":"guitar"},"bottomSections":[{"type":"RecentPostsSection","colors":"colors-d","elementId":"","showDate":false,"showAuthor":false,"showExcerpt":true,"showReadMoreLink":true,"readMoreLinkLabel":"Read more","variant":"variant-d","actions":[],"styles":{"self":{"height":"auto","width":"wide","margin":["mt-0","mb-0","ml-0","mr-0"],"padding":["pt-12","pb-56","pr-4","pl-4"],"justifyContent":"center"},"title":{"textAlign":"center"},"subtitle":{"textAlign":"center"},"actions":{"justifyContent":"center"}},"title":"Read more","subtitle":null,"recentCount":3},{"type":"DividerSection","colors":"colors-d","styles":{"self":{"width":"wide","padding":["pt-4","pb-4","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center","borderWidth":1,"borderStyle":"solid"}}}],"addTitleSuffix":true,"markdown_content":"This was the final project for a course I took on computational econometrics. It was roughly a quarter long application project utilized to demonstrate the concepts and techniques taught. Analysis of six vanguard mutual funds helped figure out the general stability and variance/standard deviation between the various assets in question. The interesting metrics that I hoped to answer were the relative growth of the fund in comparison to each other, how similar the funds are, and much more.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, this project put into perspective the necessary precautions with investments. Investment strategies aren’t cookie cutter and the individuals have different needs. It is important to cater to both risk aversion and the targeted return values of a portfolio. Diversification is a key element in order to help reduce the volatility that comes with uncertainty in the future. I think this puts into perspective the idea of trying to gain in the long term very meaningful because short term losses feel more impactful from a behavioral economics perspective. People have different reference points, but losses below someone’s reference point feel way worse than the equivalent gain of the same magnitude. This is explained from the perspective of loss aversion rather than risk aversion that challenges some of what classical economics has to say about people’s relation to fair gambles.  \r\n\r\nOverall, each individual has their own risk tolerance and desirability for return goals. This project reinforced the ideas I’ve learned in terms of balanced portfolios based on the ratio of assets for an individual or given the possible trade restrictions with a balance of risk free and/or no risk-free assets.\r\n\r\nMain Findings\r\n\r\n • Stock tracking mutual funds like vfinx, veurx, veiex, and vpacx tend to have similar time trends overtime. This was seen with the downward trend that was found in those Vanguard funds within the years of both 2015 and 2018.\r\n\r\n • The other two vanguard funds that track bonds, vbisx and vbltx, exhibited more movements together as there was a noticeable drop that occurred in the year of 2016 when Trump was elected. (Economic Times)\r\n\r\n• Stock funds (vfinx, veurx, veiex, and vpacx) were positively correlated with another and the bond funds (vbisx and vbltx) were positively correlated with each other.\r\n\r\n• The six Vanguard funds seemed to be normally distributed which allowed for GWN model analysis.\r\n\r\n• Risk and return of some individual funds like vpacx, veurx and veiex were overshadowed because they had higher risk and overall lower returns comparatively to either vfinx or vbltx.\r\n\r\n• Global minimum variance portfolio with or without short sale restriction had lower risk than holding any individual asset.\r\n\r\n• Global minimum variance portfolio with short sale restrictions had a lower sharpe ratio and overall, more risk than the global minimum variance portfolio able to short sell.    \r\n\r\nThe following are some of the visualizations and calculations done within this project:\r\n\r\n![](/images/fundprices.png)\r\n\r\n1.A) Fund's prices across time\r\n\r\n![](/images/fundreturns.png)\r\n\r\n1.B) Fund's Return Across Time\r\n\r\n![](/images/covariance%20comparison.png)\r\n\r\n2.A) Covariance comparison of the various mutual funds\r\n\r\n![](/images/risk%20and%20return%20sharpe%20ratio.png)\r\n\r\n2.B) Risk and Returns of Various Funds/Sharpe Ratios of Assets\r\n\r\n![](/images/returnsboxnwhisker-fc71221f.png)\r\n\r\n2.C) Variability and Spread via Box-And-Whisker Plot of the Funds\r\n\r\n![](/images/univariate%20descriptive%20statistics.png)\r\n\r\n3.A) Univariate Descriptive Statistics of the Funds including Skewness and Kurtosis of Historical Data\r\n\r\n![](/images/gmvNoSS.png)\r\n\r\n4.A) Global Minimum Variance Portfolio -- Portfolio with the lowest amount of risk\r\n\r\n![](/images/efficientfrontierMarkowitzbullet.png)\r\n\r\n4.B) Markowitz Bullet/Efficient Frontier of Various Optimal Portfolios w/ and w/o trade constraints\r\n\r\nAfter analysis it was possible to come up with the distributions, the type of assets these funds were tracking, and the optimal weights for short sell and short sell restricted scenarios for the funds. These samples of graphics above are some of the visualizations utilized to come up with such conclusions highlighted in the findings.\r\n\r\nGoing forward because of my interest in investments I hope to look more into the taxation aspects because it is an important facet as earnings are taxed. I wish to learn more about investments as there are ways to better portfolios and manage uncertainty. I feel like this is important both as an individual looking to partake in investments and also helping others make informed decisions about their own portfolios.\r\n"}]},{"type":"DividerSection","colors":"colors-d","styles":{"self":{"width":"wide","padding":["pt-4","pb-4","pl-4","pr-4"],"justifyContent":"center","borderWidth":1,"borderStyle":"solid"}}}],"addTitleSuffix":true,"markdown_content":"This was the final project for a course I took on computational econometrics.

This is explained from the perspective of loss aversion rather than risk aversion that challenges some of what classical economics has to say about people’s relation to fair gambles.  \r\n\r\nOverall, each individual has their own risk tolerance and desirability for return goals. This project reinforced the ideas I’ve learned in terms of balanced portfolios based on the ratio of assets for an individual or given the possible trade restrictions with a balance of risk free and/or no risk-free assets.\r\n\r\nMain Findings\r\n\r\n • Stock tracking mutual funds like vfinx, veurx, veiex, and vpacx tend to have similar time trends overtime. This was seen with the downward trend that was found in those Vanguard funds within the years of both 2015 and 2018.\r\n\r\n • The other two vanguard funds that track bonds, vbisx and vbltx, exhibited more movements together as there was a noticeable drop that occurred in the year of 2016 when Trump was elected. (Economic Times)\r\n\r\n• Stock funds (vfinx, veurx, veiex, and vpacx) were positively correlated with another and the bond funds (vbisx and vbltx) were positively correlated with each other.\r\n\r\n• The six Vanguard funds seemed to be normally distributed which allowed for GWN model analysis.\r\n\r\n• Risk and return of some individual funds like vpacx, veurx and veiex were overshadowed because they had higher risk and overall lower returns comparatively to either vfinx or vbltx.\r\n\r\n• Global minimum variance portfolio with or without short sale restriction had lower risk than holding any individual asset.\r\n\r\n• Global minimum variance portfolio with short sale restrictions had a lower sharpe ratio and overall, more risk than the global minimum variance portfolio able to short sell.    \r\n\r\nThe following are some of the visualizations and calculations done within this project:\r\n\r\n![](/images/fundprices.png)\r\n\r\n1.A) Fund's prices across time\r\n\r\n![](/images/fundreturns.png)\r\n\r\n1.B) Fund's Return Across Time\r\n\r\n![](/images/covariance%20comparison.png)\r\n\r\n2.A) Covariance comparison of the various mutual funds\r\n\r\n![](/images/risk%20and%20return%20sharpe%20ratio.png)\r\n\r\n2.B) Risk and Returns of Various Funds/Sharpe Ratios of Assets\r\n\r\n![](/images/returnsboxnwhisker-fc71221f.png)\r\n\r\n2.C) Variability and Spread via Box-And-Whisker Plot of the Funds\r\n\r\n![](/images/univariate%20descriptive%20statistics.png)\r\n\r\n3.A) Univariate Descriptive Statistics of the Funds including Skewness and Kurtosis of Historical Data\r\n\r\n![](/images/gmvNoSS.png)\r\n\r\n4.A) Global Minimum Variance Portfolio -- Portfolio with the lowest amount of risk\r\n\r\n![](/images/efficientfrontierMarkowitzbullet.png)\r\n\r\n4.B) Markowitz Bullet/Efficient Frontier of Various Optimal Portfolios w/ and w/o trade constraints\r\n\r\nAfter analysis it was possible to come up with the distributions, the type of assets these funds were tracking, and the optimal weights for short sell and short sell restricted scenarios for the funds. These samples of graphics above are some of the visualizations utilized to come up with such conclusions highlighted in the findings.\r\n\r\nGoing forward because of my interest in investments I hope to look more into the taxation aspects because it is an important facet as earnings are taxed. I wish to learn more about investments as there are ways to better portfolios and manage uncertainty. I feel like this is important both as an individual looking to partake in investments and also helping others make informed decisions about their own portfolios.\r\n"},"site":{"__metadata":{"id":"content/data/config.json","source":"sourcebit-source-filesystem","sourceName":"data","sourcePath":"C:/Users/dchen/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/energetic-sun-b54e6/content/data","relSourcePath":"config.json","relProjectPath":"content/data/config.json","modelType":"data","modelName":"Config","modelLabel":"Site configuration"},"type":"Config","favicon":"/images/favicon.svg","header":{"headerVariant":"variant-b","isSticky":true,"primaryColors":"colors-d","secondaryColors":"colors-d","title":"Danny Chen","isTitleVisible":true,"primaryLinks":[{"type":"Link","label":"Home","url":"/","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}},{"type":"Link","label":"About","url":"/about","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}},{"type":"Link","label":"Projects","url":"/blog","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}}],"secondaryLinks":[{"type":"Button","label":"Contact me","url":"mailto:dchen564@gmail.com","altText":"Contact me","style":"secondary","showIcon":true,"icon":"arrowRight","iconPosition":"right","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Button","modelLabel":"Button"}}],"styles":{"self":{"width":"narrow"}},"__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Header","modelLabel":"Header"}},"footer":{"variant":"variant-b","colors":"colors-d","title":"Danny Chen","contacts":{"title":"Contact details","phoneAltText":"Our phone","email":"dchen564@gmail.com","emailAltText":"Our email","address":"Las Vegas/Seattle","addressAltText":"Location","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"ContactBlock","modelLabel":"Contact"}},"primaryLinks":[{"type":"Link","label":"Home","url":"/","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}},{"type":"Link","label":"About","url":"/about","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}},{"type":"Link","label":"Projects","url":"/blog","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}},{"type":"Link","label":"Contact me","url":"mailto:info@lorem.mail","altText":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Link","modelLabel":"Link"}}],"socialLinks":[{"type":"Social","label":"Github","altText":"","url":"/","icon":"github","style":"link","elementId":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Social","modelLabel":"Social"}},{"type":"Social","label":"LinkedIn","altText":"","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dchen564/","icon":"linkedin","style":"link","elementId":"","__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Social","modelLabel":"Social"}}],"legalLinks":[],"styles":{"self":{"width":"narrow"}},"__metadata":{"modelType":"object","modelName":"Footer","modelLabel":"Footer"}},"defaultMetaTags":[],"env":{}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[[...slug]]","query":{"slug":["blog","post-one"]},"buildId":"t7jaTMbziVxd-wNblAOBG","assetPrefix":".","isFallback":false,"dynamicIds":[6170,9495,3419,2652],"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
