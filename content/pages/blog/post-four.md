The following project was a fun one to take part of as the leader of the project. It felt a bit ambitious to lead a group of individuals that have limited coding experience in Python. It was rewarding to be able to lead them to the completed project that turned out nice as all of us were quite interested in the MCU. Oddly enough I was the least familiar with the franchise and it's been years since I've watched a Marvel film. 

During this project I learned how to web scrape utilizing the Beautiful Soup library in Python. I realized there was a lot of inconsistency in HTML standards even for web pages on the same parent site. It was kind of annoying, but I learned how to inspect each element carefully to scrape the necessary script texts. I was in charge of doing all the script scraping and I did post scraping processing by hand because it was easy to utilize a text editor to replace html tags and also revert the escape characters back to their standard legible text forms. 

Additionally, this project was inspired by the Network of Throne project, a Game of Thrones Network Analysis.
